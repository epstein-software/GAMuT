(2016)](http://www.cell.com/ajhg/abstract/S0002-9297(16)00052-5),\r\nwe created a test based on kernel distance-covariance methodology called GAMuT for gene-based association testing of rare variants with multiple phenotypes in a sample of unrelated subjects. The analyzed phenotypes can be either continuous or categorical in nature.  The method also allows for adjustment of covariates using adjusted residuals. \r\n\r\nGAMuT is implemented as a set of R routines, which can be executed within an R environment. \r\n\r\n### The R environment\r\nR is a widely-used, free and open source software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The most recent version of R can be downloaded from the \r\n[Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](http://cran.r-project.org/)\r\nCRAN provides precompiled binary versions of R for Windows, MacOS, and select Linux distributions that are likely sufficient for many users' needs.  Users can also install R from source code;  however this may require a significant amount of effort.  For specific details on how to compile, install, and manage R and R-packages, refer to the manual [R Installation and Administration](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n### R packages required for analysis\r\nGAMuT requires the installation of the following R library:\r\n\r\n[CompQuadForm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CompQuadForm/index.html)\r\n\r\nThe easiest method to install these packages is with the following command entered in an R shell:\r\n\r\n    install.packages(\"CompQuadForm\")\r\n\r\nOne can also [install R packages from the command line]\r\n(http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Installing-packages).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Running GAMuT\r\nFor the example, we provide sample files consisting of 1000 unrelated variants\r\npossessing 6 phenotypes and who are sequenced for a set of rare variants in a gene of interest.\r\nWe show in our example R code how to implement the GAMuT test to perform an association test\r\nbetween the 6 phenotypes and the rare variants within the gene of interest. \r\n\r\nIn the [GAMuT example analysis page](http://genetics.emory.edu/labs/epstein/software/gamut/GAMuT-example-analysis.html),\r\nwe provide a step-by-step instruction on how the GAMuT code operates here.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions and technical support\r\nFor questions or concerns with the GAMuT R routines, please contact\r\n[Richard Duncan](mailto:rduncan@emory.edu) and \r\n[Michael Epstein](mailto:mpepste@emory.edu)\r\n\r\nWe appreciate any feedback you have with our site and instructions.\r\n",
